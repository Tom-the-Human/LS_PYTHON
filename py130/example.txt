Do not follow an inferior way,
    Don't live with negligence,
Do not follow a wrong view,
    Don't be engrossed in the world.

Rouse yourself! Don't be negligent!
    Live the Dharma, a life of good conduct.
One who lives the Dharma is happy
    In this world and the next.

- Dhammapada verses 167 & 168
