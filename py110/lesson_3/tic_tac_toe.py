# P
# 1 Display the initial empty 3x3 board.
    # 1 perhaps a list of lists
    # 2 but how to represent an empty square???
    # 3 board should be persistent, so best to
    #   clear screen and keep it at the top
# 2 Ask the user to mark a square.
    # 1 input selection will require a catalogue of squares
    #   or other way to target the desired square
    # 2 the board must be updated
# 3 Computer marks a square.
    # 1 how will the computer choose? randomly?
    # 2 the board must be updated
# 4 Display the updated board state.
    # 1 determine board representation including
    #    empty, marked by player, or marked by CPU
# 5 If it's a winning board, display the winner.
    # 1 print below board
# 6 If the board is full, display tie.
    # 1 print below poard
# 7 If neither player won and the board is not full, go to #2
# 8 Play again?
# 9 If yes, go to #1
# 10 Goodbye!
# You can see from the above sequence that there are two main loops:
# An outer loop between steps #1 and #9 that repeats as
# long as the player wants to keep playing.
# An inner loop between steps #2 and #7 that repeats as
# long as there is no winner and the board isn't full.

# E
#  _A__B__C_
# 1|__|_X|__|    A possible representation
# 2|__|_O|__|
# 3|_O|__|__|
# Other options will likely come to mind while working on it.

# D
# I think a list of lists for the board, with strings for board rep
# Maybe a dict for acceptable board coords
