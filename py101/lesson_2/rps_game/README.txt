     Raptor, Pterodactyl, Stegosaurus
~A dino-themed Rock, Paper, Scissors game~

**Requires cowsay and pygame libraries**
Try:
pip install cowsay
pip install pygame

(You don't need to read any of that to play this game, but it's there if you want it.)

I recommend increasing the size of your terminal window to as large as possible and turning on speakers.
Not critical, but the ASCII dinosaur may not display properly in a small terminal window.
Similarly, the game is fine without sound but much more fun with it on.
