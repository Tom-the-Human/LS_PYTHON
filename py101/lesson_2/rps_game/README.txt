Raptor, Pterodactyl, Stegosaurus
~A dino-themed Rock, Paper, Scissors game~

*Requires cowsay and pygame libraries*

I recommend increasing the size of your terminal window to as large as possible and turning on speakers.
Not critical, but the ASCII dinosaur may not display properly in a small terminal window.
Similarly, the game is fine without sound but I think more fun with it on.
